# parameters.yml: Handling Secret Config

No matter how you deploy, eventually, you hit the same problem: handling sensitive
configuration, like your production database password or Loggly token. Depending
on your app, this info will need to be stored in different places, like `parameters.yml`
for a Symfony 3 app or as environment variables for Symfony 4.

But no matter *where* the config needs to ultimately live, the problem is more or
less the same: how can we put secret things onto the server in an automated way?

## Options for parameters.yml

Like with *everything*, there are a few good answers. And this is where things
can get complicated. For `parameters.yml`, one option is to store the production
`parameters.yml` in a private S3 bucket. Then, during deployment, use the `s3`
Ansible module to download that into your project.

Another option - the way that *we* will do it - is to store a `parameters.yml.dist`
file in our project, and make it dynamic by printing Ansible variables inside it.
To keep things secure, those variables will be stored in the Ansible vault.

## Setting up the Deploy Vault

Let's create a new vault to store the secret values:

```terminal
ansible-vault create ansible/vars/deploy_vault.yml
```

Choose a safe password... something safer than what I'll choose: `beefpass`.
Here's the plan: we will define some new variables here, then use them inside
`parameters.yml.dist`. So, what needs to be dynamic? For now the `secret`,
`loggly_token`, `database_host`, `database_user` and `database_pass`.

Back in the vault, create some variables: `vault_symfony_secret` set to
`udderly secret $tring` and `vault_loggly_token` set to our production loggly
token... this long string:

```yaml
# ansible/vars/deploy_vault.yml
---
vault_symfony_secret: 'udderly secret $string'
vault_loggly_token: 'fb4aa5b2-30a3-4bd8-8902-1aba5a683d62'
```

Oh, and, get your own token... because this is fake.

Then, `vault_database_host: 127.0.0.1`, `vault_database_user: root`, and
`vault_database_password` set to `null`:

```yaml
# ansible/vars/deploy_vault.yml
---
vault_symfony_secret: 'udderly secret $string'
vault_loggly_token: 'fb4aa5b2-30a3-4bd8-8902-1aba5a683d62'
vault_database_host: 127.0.0.1
vault_database_user: root
vault_database_password: null
```

In the provision playbook, we actually install a MySQL server locally. That's
why I'm using the local database server... and no, I haven't *bothered* to create
a proper user with a decent password. But you *should*.

But also, if I were using AWS for a real application, I would use Amazon's RDS -
basically, a hosted MySQL or PostgreSQL database - so that I don't need to manage
it on my own. In that case, the database host would be something specific to
my RDS instance. But, it's the same idea.

***TIP
If you decide to use Amazon's RDS - basically, you need to perform the next steps:

1. Create an RDS instance. The easiest way to do this is by hand via the AWS web interface;
2. Put its credentials in the Ansible Vault.

You can automate the creation of the RDS instance, though itâ€™s not as important because
these instances are not destroyed and recreated in the same way as EC2 instances.

Save this file and quit. We now have a new, but encrypted, file with those variables:

[[[ code('5a779a0261') ]]]

Inside `deploy.yml`, under `vars_files`, add `./vars/deploy_vault.yml`:

[[[ code('f8aaf31e82') ]]]

## Creating a Simpler Variables File

At this point, we *could* go directly into `parameters.yml.dist` and start using
those `vault_` variables. But, as a best practice, I like to create a separate vars
file - `deploy_vars.yml` - where I assign each of those `vault_` variables to a normal
variable. Just, stay with me.

Re-open the vault file - type `beefpass`:

```terminal-silent
ansible-vault edit ansible/vars/deploy_vault.yml
```

And copy everything. Then, in `deploy_vars.yml`, paste that. Now, for each variable,
create a *new* variable that's set to it, but *without* the `vault_` prefix:

[[[ code('bb5a60dbf0') ]]]

This is totally optional. The advantage is that you can quickly see a list of *all*
available variables, without needing to open the vault. I can just look in here and say:

> Oh! Apparently there is a variable called `symfony_secret`!

Back in `deploy.yml`, import this new file: `./vars/deploy_vars.yml`:

[[[ code('0b77ddfbee') ]]]

## Variables inside parameters.yml.dist

Finally, in `parameters.yml.dist`, let's print some variables! For `database_host`,
print `{{ database_host }}`. Repeat that for `database_user`, `database_password`,
and then down below for `symfony_secret`, and `loggly_token`:

[[[ code('ed879c3fec') ]]]

That's it! We put secret things in the vault and then print them inside the parameters
file.

Let's try it. Run the playbook with the same command:

```terminal-silent
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/deploy.yml
```

Yep! This fails because it can't decrypt the vault file. From now on, we need
to add a `--ask-vault-pass` flag. And then type, `beefpass`:

```terminal-silent
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/deploy.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

If this gets really annoying, you can store the password in a file and use
`--vault-password-file` to point to it. Just don't commit that file to your repository!

And... done! Let's go check it out! Move out of the `current/` directory and then
back in:

```terminal-silent
cd ..
cd current
```

Deep breath: open `parameters.yml`. Yes! Everything has its dynamic vault
value!

Ok, we're getting *really* close! Next, let's run Composer and fix some permissions!
